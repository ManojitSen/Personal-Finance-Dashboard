# Personal-Finance-Dashboard
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive personal finance dashboard using Power BI to empower users in managing their financial health effectively. The dashboard integrates various financial data sources, providing insights into income, expenses, savings, and investments.

Key Features:

Income and Expense Tracking: Visual representations of monthly income and expenditures, categorized by type (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment) to identify spending patterns.

Budget Management: A budget vs. actual analysis to help users set financial goals and monitor their adherence to budgets.

Savings Insights: Visualization of savings trends over time, including progress towards savings goals and emergency fund status.

Investment Overview: An overview of investment portfolios, performance metrics, and asset allocation to assist in making informed investment decisions.

Interactive Filters and Drill-Downs: Users can interact with the dashboard through filters to view specific time periods, categories, or accounts, enhancing data exploration and analysis.

Alerts and Recommendations: Automated alerts for overspending in certain categories and personalized recommendations for optimizing savings.

Technical Implementation:

Utilizing Power BIâ€™s robust data modeling capabilities, this project integrates data from various sources, such as bank statements and investment accounts. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is employed for calculated fields, enhancing analytical depth.

The dashboard not only facilitates better financial decision-making but also promotes financial literacy among users by presenting complex data in an intuitive and engaging format. This project serves as a practical tool for individuals seeking to improve their financial well-being.
